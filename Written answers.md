# Part 2 (Written Questions)

## Question 2.2 : Code Review

## Issues and proposed improvements in the Code

1. **Missing input validation:** input data should be validated in order to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

2. **Lack of error handling:**  errors should be handled during the `db.addUser(user)` operation to avoid unhandled exceptions and crashes.

3. **Inconsistent response status codes:** We should use consistent status code (e.g., 201 - Created) for successful user addition and provide meaningful response messages.

4. **Lack of error messages for clients:** The code should be modified to provide descriptive error messages to help clients understand issues.

5. **Inefficient database call:** The code can be modified to use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the event loop and improve scalability.

6. **Code organization and readability:** We can improve the formatting and organization of that code  for better readability and maintainability.

I think by addressing these issues and implementing the proposed improvements, the code can become more robust, maintainable, and client-friendly.

# Part 3 (Time Management Task)

## Task Prioritization and Timeline

## Tasks to be completed

1. Fix a critical bug in the login module. (Priority: High, Urgency: Immediate)
2. Document the API you developed in Task 1. (Priority: Medium, Urgency: Moderate)
3. Optimize the database queries in an existing module. (Priority: Medium, Urgency: Moderate)
4. Develop a new feature that has been highly requested by clients. (Priority: Low, Urgency: Flexible)

## Timeline

I would prioritize the tasks as follows
### Day 1

- **Fix a critical bug in the login module:**
  - I'll investigate and reproduce the bug.
  - Analyze the codebase in order to identify the possible causes of the bug.
  - Implement necessary fixes and thoroughly test the changes.

### Day 2

- **Document the API developed in Task 1:**
  - Create clear and concise documentation, including endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
  - Review and revise the documentation for accuracy and clarity.
  - Allocate time for peer review if applicable.
- **Optimize the database queries in the existing module:**
  - Identify the queries that can be optimized.
  - Evaluate potential improvements and implement the optimized queries.
  - Perform testing to ensure the changes don't introduce regressions and measure performance improvements.

### Day 3

- **Continue optimizing database queries if additional time is needed.**
- **Perform thorough testing to ensure the changes don't introduce any regressions.**
- **Conduct performance testing to measure the impact of query optimizations.**
- **Begin development of the new feature highly requested by clients:**
  - Analyze the requirements and design the feature's implementation.
  - Start working on the initial implementation of the feature.

### Day 4

- **Continue development of the new feature:**
  - Implement the feature's functionality according to the requirements.
  - Test the feature thoroughly to ensure it meets the expected behavior.
  - Address any issues or bugs that arise during testing.

### Day 5

- **Finalizing the development and testing of the new feature.**
- **Perform comprehensive regression testing to ensure the overall system stability.**
- **Conducting a final review of all my tasks, making any necessary adjustments, and ensuring completion of documentation and optimization tasks.**

## Reasoning

The 5 days timeline I created focuses on addressing critical issues first and allocating enough time for each task:

- I made sure the  critical bug in the login module is prioritized and resolved on Day 1 in order to ensure system stability and security.
- I placed API documentation and database query optimization concurrently on Day 2 and Day 3 in order to save time.
- Development of the new feature follows, allowing two days for its implementation, testing, and bug fixing.
- The final day is dedicated to completing pending tasks, conducting regression testing, and ensuring the overall completion of all planned activities.

This plan I created is to ensure that high-priority tasks are accomplished within the given timeframe while allowing for efficient task management and timely resolution of critical issues.
